# IP Address Microservice

This code was based on the Request Header Parser Microservice project. Instructions for this exercise can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice

I further developed this package to determine the best way to access the client IP address from a request.
